# AnalysisofModelsforSarcasmdetection

The codes includes two csv file Balanced (having samples of equal weightage of the two classes) and Imbalanced (having samples of unequal weightage of two classes).

Following models were trained and tested on both the balanced and imbalanced csv file

1)  Logistic Regression
2)  LSTM
3)  Bi-directional LSTM
4)  BERT 
5)  Roberta
6)  Ensemble Model (Multiple BERT/Roberta)

There is a separate notebook file for each model and dataset. Run entire notebook atonce or cell by cell.

For Ensemble notebook uncomment the Bert or Roberta code as per which model to be used
